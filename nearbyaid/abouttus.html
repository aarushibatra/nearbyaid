      <h2>Welcome to NearbyAid</h2>
      <p>What's better than humans helping humans? If we as a community help each other, lend our hand or mind for a while and get good returns-then our team believes we must give it a try.</p>
      <br>
      <p><b>This page is dedicated to community service.</b> We can find and help people in 10km of our range and get the amount of money claimed or we can rather add what service we need and what amount of money can we provide for it. As simple as that! </p>
      <p>The website is currently on its version 1.0.0 started on 12.04.2020</p>
      <h2>Team NearbyAid</h2>
